# SinkaDotCom
This is a simple Sink a Dot Com Game.

Goal: Sink all of the computer's Dot Coms in the fewest possible guesses.

Setup: When the game program is launched, the computer places 3 Dot Coms on a virtual 7x7 grid. When that is complete, the game asks for your first guess.

How you play: The computer will prompt you to enter a cell that you'll type at the command line. In response to your guess, you'll see a result at the command line either "Hit", "Miss" or "You sunk Pets.com"
When you have sent all the 3 Dot Coms to that big 404 in the sky, the game ends by printing your rating to the command line.
